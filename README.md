## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic JavaScript syntax

### What I learned

This challenge was a great refresher for me on simple front-end concepts, nothing too fancy or complicated involved within the codebase. Just pure CSS3 at work! In addition, this project required a touch of Vanilla JS for the main functionalities, therefore I could revise my JavaScript in the process. The biggest challenge for me was definitely figuring out how to implement the social panel on/off toggle (which a required a whole lot of css just to get everything right) as well as coloring the svg simultaneously with the panel. There could be a better solution but this was my best attempt!

### Continued development

I don't think I will be doing any more development on this project given its scope. Probably be looking into more difficult challenges in the future.
